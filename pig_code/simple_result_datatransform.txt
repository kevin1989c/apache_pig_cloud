I have 3 images that makeup a 'container'.

<p>The nice thing about this is that the width of the table is always the width of the browser (or parent) and the middle column where the content is dynamically sizes to take up the remaining space between the left/right images.</p>

51	5642315	"	40769	Regular Expression to get a string between two strings in Javascript	<p>I have found very similar posts but I can't quite get my regular expression right here.</p>

<p>I am trying to write a regular expression which returns a string which is between two other strings. For example: I want to get the string which resides between the strings "cow" and "milk"</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My cow always gives milk</p>
</blockquote>

<p>would return</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"always gives"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the expression I have pieced together so far:</p>

<pre><code>(?=cow).*(?=milk)
</code></pre>

<p>However this returns the string "cow always gives"</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>I was able to get what I needed using Martinho Fernandes' solution below.  The exact code is:</p>

<pre><code>var test = "My cow always gives milk";

var testRE = test.match("cow(.*)milk");
alert(testRE[1]);
</code></pre>

<p>You'll notice that I am alerting the testRE variable as an array.  This is because testRE is returning as an array, for some reason.  The output from:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My cow always gives milk</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Changes into:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>always gives</p>

<ul> Baz</ul></ul></ul></ul></p>

<p>Long story short, I want to have many packages, each with many subpackages, in a source folder (and several source folders, so making more won't solve the problem)--so on the order of a couple hundred packages per source folder--ten to twenty packages each with fifteen subpackages. Therefore, I want the hierarchy to look like this:</p>

<ul>

<ul><li>OtherPackage <ul> Foobar

<ul> Baz</ul></ul></ul></ul></ul>

<p>so I can open or close a package and see a list of subpackages instead of having package and subpackage all at the same level in the hierarchy--which again makes far too many packages simultaneously displayed. Note this is <em>not</em> a question about filesystem; the file system works fine as far as I can tell--it is only a question about the <em>visual display</em> in the Eclipse package explorer.</p>

<li>OtherPackage <ul> Foobar </ul><li> OtherPackage.SubPackage
<ul> Baz</ul></ul></ul></ul></p>

<p>Long story short, I want to have many packages, each with many subpackages, in a source folder (and several source folders, so making more won't solve the problem)--so on the order of a couple hundred packages per source folder--ten to twenty packages each with fifteen subpackages. Therefore, I want the hierarchy to look like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>PROJECT
<ul><li> Source Folder 
         <ul><li>Package
<ul> Class
<li>Package.SubPackage
<ul> Foo</ul>
<ul>Bar</ul><li>Package.OtherSubPackage<ul><li>Package.OtherSubPackage.VerySubPackage</ul></ul></ul>
<ul><li>OtherPackage <ul> Foobar
<li> OtherPackage.SubPackage
<ul> Baz</ul></ul></ul></ul></ul>

<p>so I can open or close a package and see a list of subpackages instead of having package and subpackage all at the same level in the hierarchy--which again makes far too many packages simultaneously displayed. Note this is <em>not</em> a question about filesystem; the file system works fine as far as I can tell--it is only a question about the <em>visual display</em> in the Eclipse package explorer.</p>

<p>So: is there a way to add levels to the hierarchy? Thanks!! (Eclipse Helios on OS X 10.6)</p>

I'm trying to add an onclick event to a table row through Javascript.</p>

<p>This works as expected in Firefox, but in Internet Explorer (IE8) I can't access the table cells. I believe that is somehow related to the fact that "this" in the onclick function is identified as "Window" instead of "Table" (or something like that).</p>

Details of the various parts are below.</p>

<pre><code>   var ObjectA = {
        "Name": 1,
        "Starting": new Date(1221644506800),

        "Timeline": [

        ]
    };

<p>I am not sure how this object can be passed to a Controller Method, I have this method below where the Timelines object mirrors the above JS object using Properties.</p>

<pre><code>public JsonResult Save(Timelines person)
